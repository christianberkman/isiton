# Is It On?
Is It On? is a very simple tool created the complete internet disconnection in Uganda in January 2021. I challanged myself to create this tool with only offline documentation at hand for jQuery, Bootstrap and PHP -- courtesy of www.devdocs.io

# What it does
The tool (attempts) to check if the listed platforms can be reached from the local device by loading their ` /favicon.ico`. Most domains have this file and make it accessible.

Is It On? will work globally but is geared towards the blocking of Social Media in Uganda.

# Limitations
* Not all websites offer the `/favicon.ico` file or block external loading.
* The accessibility of services can not always be determined just by their website, for example the Google Play Store. While https://play.google.com may load fine, downloading apps from an Android phone may be blocked via other avenues.
